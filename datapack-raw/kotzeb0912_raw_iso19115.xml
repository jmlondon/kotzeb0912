      <abstract>This dataset represents the satellite telemetry data from deployments on 7 adult Bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) captured and released near Kotzebue, Alaska between 2009 and 2012. Bearded seals are one of the most important subsistence resources for the indigenous people of coastal northern and western Alaska, as well as key components of Arctic marine ecosystems, yet relatively little about their abundance, seasonal distribution, migrations, or foraging behaviors has been documented scientifically. Capture efforts were based out of Kotzebue in June and July from 2009 to 2012. In all, 2 adults and 5 sub-adults were released with satellite tags: 4 males and three females. Length and weight ranged from 159 cm and 116 kg to 216 cm and 253 kg. Each seal was released with two different types of satellite-linked, geo-locating data recorders from Wildlife Computers (Redmond, Washington, USA). The SPOT type tags were attached to a rear flipper. These tags provide information on the timing of haul out behavior and on the seal’s location for up to three years. The MK10 type was glued to hair on the top of a seal’s head. These tags provided the same information as the SPOT type and also provided data on the timing and depths of dives, for up to ten months. This dataset includes the 'raw archive' data as obtained from the Wildlife Computers data portal. A separate dataset includes a 'processed' dataset that has been cleaned and organized for more efficient data analysis. Most users will only be interested in the 'processed' dataset. Several R/Rmarkdown (*.Rmd) files describe the process in more detail along with source code used for any data manipulation.</abstract>
      <purpose>This dataset represents a complete archive of the satellite telemetry data from this research effort. This provides a preserved archive of these data.</purpose>
