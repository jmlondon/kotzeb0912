Bearded seals (*Erignathus barbatus*) are one of the most important subsistence resources for the indigenous people of coastal northern and western Alaska, as well as key components of Arctic marine ecosystems, yet relatively little about their abundance, seasonal distribution, migrations, or foraging behaviors has been documented scientifically. Ice-associated seal populations may be negatively impacted by offshore oil and gas development as well as by climate change. Our ability to predict impacts, however, is limited by inadequate knowledge of seal population structure and foraging ecology. By working cooperatively with Alaska Native subsistence hunters we developed methods for live-capturing bearded seals in the Chukchi Sea using nets set in the shallow coastal waters where bearded seals were foraging. Capture efforts were based out of Kotzebue and various locations in the North Slope Borough from Wainwright to Barrow in June and July from 2009 to 2012. In all, 7 seals were caught (2 adults and 5 sub-adults; 4 males and three females; ranging in length and weight from 159 cm and 116 kg to 216 cm and 253 kg), all from Kotzebue Sound. Each seal was sampled for health and condition and released with three different types of satellite-linked bio-loggers: the SPOT5, attached to a rear flipper, provided information on the timing of hauling out and on the seal’s location for up to three years; the MK10, glued to the top of a seal’s head, provided Argos estimates of location and also provided data on the timing and depths of dives, for up to ten months; the Mk10-AF, also glued to the top of the head, provided GPS quality locations in addition to the Argos estimates of location and dive behavior data.
